  "description": "Taking pictures is fun, so let’s play a game about it.  The objective of the game is to take pictures of insects … yes that’s right, bugs!  We are talking about butterflies, dragonflies, bees, wasps, etc.  Each level will have 1 or more bugs for you to catch and shoot a picture with your camera.  The fastest you capture all your targets and with the less number of shoots taken the higher your score.  But be careful, some bugs can sting, and it may hurt so watch out and stay away from those aggressive insects … well, unless you have to take a picture of them.\n\nThe game contains many insects, many beautiful environments, and many levels to enjoy.  You can control your camera using the D-pad or just swiping on the screen.  There are 3 difficulty levels to try, and you can adjust your shooting button (left/right).  The game also has some educational information for you to get to know your bugs!  \n\nSo go ahead and enjoy the game!\n\nNOTE: More levels on the way …",
