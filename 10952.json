  "description": "In this simple, sweet, and very human picture book, Mercer Mayer's popular Little Critter shows us all the things he can do by himself. He starts by tying his shoes (almost) and continues by pouring his own juice and spilling just a little! The wry illustrations often point to the fact that Little Critter doesn't do everything perfectly, but he always makes an effort to do the best he can!\n\nMercer Mayer's Little Critter stories, which address all the major issues of growing up, are perennial favorites of parents and children.\n\nNew features only available in this interactive omBook include professional narration, background audio and enlarged artwork for each scene.  \n\nTo promote reading in young children, individual words are highlighted as the story is read and words zoom up when pictures are touched. By combining the original text and artwork of author Mercer Mayer with features that entertain and promote reading, this omBook appeals to readers of all ages.\n\nThree ways to read this omBook:\n★ \"Read to Me\" — listen to the narrated story with words highlighted as they are read\n★ \"Read it Myself\" — read the book in its traditional form\n★ \"Auto Play\" — plays like a movie, automatically reading and turning pages. Great for younger children!\n\nAdditional Features:\n★ Picture / Word association — words zoom up and are spoken when pictures are touched\n★ Find the creature mini-game\n★ Professional audio narration\n★ Custom background audio for each scene\n★ Pages pan & zoom to accentuate the beautiful, original art of Mercer Mayer\n\nOfficial Mercer Mayer licensed app: www.littlecritter.com\n\nLITTLE CRITTER, MERCER MAYER’S LITTLE CRITTER and MERCER MAYER’S LITTLE CRITTER and LOGO are trademarks of Orchard House Licensing Company.
