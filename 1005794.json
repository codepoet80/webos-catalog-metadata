  "description": "The Getting Things Done (GTD) crew is about to get a welcome surprise from the developers at Knowified Software in the form of a webOS app that will help you, well, get things done. We've reviewed other methods of GTD on webOS devices in the past, like that of Outline Tracker (which syncs with Backpack and Basecamp), but Knowified Software has decided that these other methods just aren't what they are looking for in a GTD app. Which brings us to their new product, tasks@hand.",
