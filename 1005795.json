  "description": "This patched version of PulseAudio Restarter does more than just restarting Pulse Audio. While the original version, which is still available in Preware, attempted to resolve audio distortion by restarting the Pulse Audio service, this version, patched by community member filmor_, goes even further and also restarts the the audio daemon. This seems to fix distortion 99% of the time, avoid an annoying (and long) reboot.",
