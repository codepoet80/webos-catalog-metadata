  "description": "Do your black & white digital photographs leave you feeling uninspired, lifeless, and dull.  Well, get in the Zone—the Zone System, that is.\n\nBased on an award-winning presentation, GetZoned will help put you “In the Zone.” \n\nThe Zone System is the photographic relationship between luminance, film speed (ISO for digital), shutter speed, and aperture diameter that was developed by Fred Archer and Ansel Adams in the late 1930s. While the name of Fred Archer might not strike a familiar chord except in the most ardent shutterbug’s mind, the late Ansel Adams is revered by many as the father of landscape photography. His majestic monochromatic views of Yosemite National Forest have evoked awe in the eye of every beholder for years.\n\nTypically, books, Web sites, and classes dealing with the Zone System have been shrouded in way too much technical mumbo-jumbo. Not so with GetZoned.\n\nThe presentation utilized in GetZoned was awarded a Maggie Award for the best “how-to” article in a consumer magazine – it's simple, easy-to-understand, and, best of all, fun!\n\nInside GetZoned you will find:\n\n\t* “In the Zone” - an introduction to the Zone System\n\t* “Gallery” - a slideshow presentation of “zoned” photographs\n\t* “Do the Math” - the heart of GetZoned with enough soul that you won't be scared away\n\t*  2 Free Test Prints - a printable gray test card and a sample \"zoned\" print\n\t*  Made exclusively for the HP TouchPad\n\nIf you've ever wanted to learn how to take professional-grade black & white photographs with your digital camera, GetZoned is the App for you. Get “in the Zone” with GetZoned!\n\nPlease note: in order to get the maximum benefit from GetZoned, you will need a handheld light meter. The model referenced in GetZoned is a Gossen Luna-Pro.",
