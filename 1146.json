  "description": "**Update: All broken features have been fixed. And now has back gestures***\n\nWake N Play is thee alarm app for the Pre! It is the only alarm that is designed to wake up your brain. With Wake N Play you don’t get woken up gently, or shake the phone, nope, you just click the off button and are presented with five multiple choice trivia questions. Answer all five and you’re up for the day -or night…..but if you take to long to answer, say doze off, the alarm sounds again. The questions are from different fields of knowledge so to really get you thinkin’, and are presented at random to lessen the ability to memorize the Q&A’s.  This app is designed for two people, ones who can’t seem to wake up in the morning, and people who love trivia. If you’re one or both of those people, then Wake N Play is for you!\n-Over 150 questions\n-Multiple Alarm Sounds\n-Desktop Clock Function\n-Alarm sounds when closed! \n\nNew in the 1.1 update:\n\nAbility to set reoccurring Alarms -Once, Daily, Monthly (tap screen where it says 'once')\n\nBetter randomizations of the over 100 questions -less repeats \n\nExtended time for answering the questions to turn off the alarm\n\nMinor Bug fixes, including date/time set display, Pixi formatting and over all stabilization. \n\nBack Gestures ",
