  "description": "In this app you can download & store chapters for listening without an internet connection, perhaps on your next flight or road trip. These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nPlato’s account of Socrates’ defense at his trial for “corrupting the youth” is a classic summation of his teacher’s life and mission, centered in Socrates’ most famous line, “The unexamined life is not worth living.” (Summary by FrZeile) \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.",
