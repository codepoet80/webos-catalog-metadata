  "description": "Curator's Note: This entry has been restored using a Beta IPK and is tested working in 2022. Originally released as NDrive Navigation USA, this Beta can be used to purchase maps for most of the world. Purchases have to be done on another device, but can be restored to your webOS device. Be aware many webOS devices struggle to get a GPS fix -- test yours before purchasing maps.\r\n\nTo get apps, start the purchase on the webOS device you want to use. The built-in browser will be unable to render the purchase page, but will show the correct link. Copy the link from your webOS browser's address bar, and email it to (or otherwise get it onto) a modern computer.\r\nFrom your computer, complete the purchase of maps you want.\r\nReturn to your webOS Device, go to the NDrive Store, and choose My Products, then Download.\r\nThe download will take a long time, depending on your location, however it can be safely resumed if cancelled.\n\nTurn-by-turn navigation for webOS has finally arrived!\n\nNDrive 11 transforms your Smartphone into a powerful turn-by-turn navigation device. \n\nThe award winning application bundles a number of new features that exceed the field of simple turn-by -turn navigation including Social Network integration, Weather, location sharing to name a few.\n\nNDrive 11 uses the latest NAVTEQ maps which are stored on your device, allowing you to navigate without the need of network connectivity.\n\nNDrive 11 beyond navigation:\n- Nearby offers (Coupons)\n- Facebook and Foursquare integration\n- Live weather \n- NDrive’s in-app store\n\nNDrive 11 Navigation Faster and smarter: \n- Radar and speed limit notifications\n- NAVTEQ POIs enhanced with Google Search Functions\n- Lane assistance\n- Adventure mode\n\nOn-Board:\n-35 Supported languages, written and spoken include: English, Spanish, German, French, etc.\n-NDrive 11’s maps are provided by NAVTEQ: (March 2011)\nNDrive USA application includes the following countries and territories:\n- USA, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands",
  "version": "11.3.33", "versionNote":"This app requires a GPS fix, which can be hard/impossible to do on most devices these days. As an alternative, you can get basic maps that use approximate location by downloading the new-for-2022 Map Lite app.",
