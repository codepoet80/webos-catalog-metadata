  "description": "In this app you can download & store chapters for listening without an internet connection, perhaps on your next flight or road trip. These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\n    ‘The Forsyte Saga’ is the story of a wealthy London family stretching from the eighteen-eighties until the nineteen-twenties.\n\n    The Man of Property is the first book in the saga. The ‘man of property’ of the title is Soames Forsyte, a partner in the family law firm. He is married to Irene but the marriage is not happy and during the book she falls in love with another man.\n\n    Another branch of the family is headed by ‘Old Jolyon,’ estranged from his bohemian artist son ‘Young Jolyon’ and the story tells of their rapprochement and of Young Jolyon’s daughter June who is engaged to an architect Philip Bosinney.\n\n    For those familiar with the Forsytes, this book takes us up to the night when Soames exercises his ‘rights’ and to the death of Bosinney.\n    (Summary by Andy Minter)\n\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.",
