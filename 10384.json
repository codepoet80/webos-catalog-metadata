  "description": "Curator's Note - I know most of us soldier through podcasts with Dr Podder, but I find it slow and unpredictable. I've been using Video PodCatcher Deluxe on my TouchPad for the past few weeks, and its a better experience. Despite the name, this works for audio podcasts too. It doesn't have a directory, so you have to input the feeds by URL, but once set-up, its quite performant. (There's a free and open source podcast directory at podcastindex.org.) It doesn't get bogged down trying to process feeds, it just loads them when needed -- and remarkably quickly too. Streaming doesn't seem to work, but hit the download button, and in a few seconds, you're ready to go.\r\n\nVideo PodCatcher Deluxe is a full-featured audio and video podcatcher designed to manage your podcast content whilst on the go.\nAmongst basic playback functionality, Video PodCatcher Deluxe features a sophisticated three column layout. One contains the podcast list, another displays episodes currently available (for a selected feed) and the latter column clearly displays podcast episode descriptions. Multiple feeds are also supported within this simple design and can easily be searched while playing. The integrated podcast finder gets you going quickly.\nIn addition, this premium version allows downloading of episodes, resumes to the last play position on restart, and adds support for episode filters (new/old episodes). Conveniently, downloads can be accessed easily within this interface and there is a playlist option for uninterrupted back to back playback.\nPlease note: Video PodCatcher Deluxe will only playback media formats supported by the device! See http://www.podcatcher-deluxe.com for more information.\nThis software is available in English, German, French, and Spanish.",
