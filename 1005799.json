  "description": "Check Mate HD is a cross-platform version of Check Mate, which was originally released for webOS in 2019. If you're on a webOS phone, you should use the original version. If you're on a TouchPad, running any OS, you can use this one. Check Mate HD works on webOS (with an HTTPS proxy) and LuneOS, and when built as an APK, works on Android too. You can even use the web app on a modern PC or Mac at https://checkmate.webosarchive.com!\r\n\nCheck Mate is the simplest of To Do lists. No data is shared with anyone else, there's no special permissions needed, no ads and no tracking. Tasks can be created, edited and checked off. When you're ready to clean-up, hit the Sweep icon to have completed tasks entirely and permanently removed.\r\nThe app is backed by a service, and I host an instance of it for webOS users. You're welcome to use it, but you're just as welcome to run your own, so you're in complete control. The source code for this app, and for the back-end, are on my GitHub: github.com/codepoet",
