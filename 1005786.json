  "description": "A news app for webOS. I wrote an equivalent of NewsG as a webview app. It's called NewsZ and the inspiration should be evident. The app is just a webview, which displays a website. The web server does all the work of converting and displaying the RSS feeds.",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "versionNote": "- 0.1.0 - NewsZ has been updated with new 'mobilizer' code forked from FrogFind (See it at FrogFind! and https://github.com/ActionRetro/FrogFind) and it works quite nicely on my Pre3 again.\r\n- 0.2.0 - Touchpad optimized, with Share to email feature added.",
