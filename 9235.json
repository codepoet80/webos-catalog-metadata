  "description": "Curator's Note: Unbelievably this app still works almost flawlessly with my up-to-date self-hosted Wordpress blog -- with the caveat that I don't have forced HTTPS turned-on. YMMV, and you may need a proxy server for Wordpress-hosted sites. Stats don't fully load, but I can review and approve comments, edit and publish posts, and maintain pages.\n\nAs a side note, if you're savvy enough to be on this aging platform, and you don't already contribute to long form authorship somewhere, why not try it? The Internet would be a better place if we expressed our ideas with thoughtful prose, rather than shouty YouTube clips or angry tweets...","versionNote":"WordPress for webOS enables you to manage your blog wherever you happen to be at the time. Available in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Italian, Dutch, and Japanese.\n\nWordPress for webOS uses the innovative Cards feature, which allows you to quickly switch between managing, editing, and browsing content. Tap an email address or website URL within the app and a new card is launched and stacked for fast and intuitive navigation.\n\n* Sliding panels make it easy to manage comments, drafts, posts, and pages. Tap any item to drill down further.\n* The visual editor enables you to format text, add links, and embed media into your posts and pages.\n* Works with both WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress blogs.\n* The app notifies you of new pending comments.\n* WordPress Stats are built right in (requires Jetpack for self-hosted blogs, more info at www.jetpack.me).\n\nWordPress for webOS is 100% Open Source (GPLv2).
