The action is set in London, in “the present”, and takes place within a single day. “Sooner or later,” Wilde notes, “we shall all have to pay for what we do.” But he adds that, “No one should be entirely judged by their past.” (Summary from Wikipedia)\n\nCharacters:\nNarrator – Read by Alex Foster\nThe Earl Of Caversham, K.G. – Read by Linton\nViscount Goring, his son – Read by John Gonzalez\nSir Robert Chiltern, Bart., Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs – Read by David Barnes\nVicomte De Nanjac, Attache at the French Embassy in London – Read by Juho Fröjd\nMr. Montford – Read by Matthew Walton\nMason, Butler to Sir Robert Chiltern – Read by Hugh McGuire\nPhipps, Lord Goring’s servant – Read by Juho Fröjd\nJames, footman – Read by Read by Chris Goringe\nHarold, footman – Read by Zachary Brewster-Geisz\nLady Chiltern – Read by Kristin Hughes\nLady Markby – Read by Heather Barnett\nThe Countess Of Basildon – Read by JemmaBlythe\nMrs. Marchmont – Read by Ezwa\nMiss Mabel Chiltern, Sir Robert Chiltern’s sister – Read by Ophelia Darcy\nMrs. Cheveley – Read by Betsie Bush\nProject Editor – Paula Berinstein \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
