  "description": "Curator's Note - Robert Broglia's emulators are virtually flawless, and have a better user experience than some of the other offerings in the Catalog. I spent hours playing Zelda - Link to the Past for SNES on my TouchPad this weekend, and performance and gameplay were perfect. Search for Robert's name in the Games section to find his other emulators. They're a totally awesome use-case for webOS devices!",
  "versionNote": "Super Nintendo/Famicom (SNES/SFC) emulator based on Snes9x 1.43. Runs well on the Pre with auto-frameskip. Install the \"Remove Tap Locator\" patch from Preware to improve performance when using touch controls. NOTE: The user must supply their own game ROMs and transfer them to the device's internal storage for use with this app.\n\nFeatures:\n* Supports games in .smc and .sfc formats, optionally in .zip files\n* Backup memory and save state support, auto-save and ten manual slots for save states. State files from Snes9x 1.43 should work on Snes9x EX and vice-versa. (NOTE: write access to /media/internal is required, some versions of WebOS 1.4.5 are broken and need to be re-installed via WebOS Doctor)\n* Configurable on-screen multi-touch controls & keyboard support\n* iCade support (WebOS 2.0 or later)\n* Portrait/Landscape orientation support\n\nFollow me on Twitter for updates about my apps:\nhttps://twitter.com/rakashazi\n\nVisit the homepage at explusalpha.com for more info, ports for other platforms, and my other apps.","originalCategory":"Games",
