  "description": "Curator's Note - Recovered from archives, with info found on GitHub. It seems to work poorly with MP4s but reports on the forums suggest its usable for AVI and FLV. Create a 'videos' folder in \\media\\internal \n\nMPlayer is a movie player which runs on many systems. It plays most MPEG/VOB, FLV, AVI, Ogg/OGM, VIVO, ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, RealMedia, Matroska, NUT, NuppelVideo, FLI, YUV4MPEG, FILM, RoQ, PVA files, supported by many native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs. You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5, WMV and even H.264 movies.\n\nChomper from the Treo8 forums released a PDK-based MPlayer app for webOS. This is a separate unofficial continuation of that project. This project, however, is not PDK-based. Instead, it runs with a Mojo app frontend and a Node.js backend service (and a Java service, for backwards compatability with webOS 1.4.5 devices).\n\nThis offers several advantages. For one, cross-app launching can be used to let other developers open/stream videos in MPlayer. In addition, I've included the option to register MPlayer as a file handler, so MPlayer can be used as the system default player for extensions of your choice, allowing apps like Web, Email, and Internalz to use MPlayer without modification.",
